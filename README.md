## Using Just

This repo includes a `justfile` for common tasks. Run `just` to see available commands:

```bash
just              # Show available commands
just init         # Run one-time setup
just stow         # Symlink dotfiles
just update-zsh   # Update zsh-quickstart-kit subtree
just update-plugins  # Update zgenom plugins
just regen        # Regenerate zgenom init.zsh
```

## Configuration Structure

This repo uses fragment files in `~/.zshrc.d/` for configuration. Files are loaded in alphanumeric order:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `50-base.zsh` | Base config (pyenv, golang, nvm, etc.) - loaded everywhere |
| `50-base-aliases.zsh` | Base aliases - loaded everywhere |
| `50-base-functions.zsh` | Base functions - loaded everywhere |
| `80-airbnb.zsh` | Airbnb config - **auto-detects environment** |
| `80-airbnb-aliases.zsh` | Airbnb aliases - **auto-detects environment** |
| `80-airbnb-functions.zsh` | Airbnb functions - **auto-detects environment** |

The work-specific files automatically detect the environment and only load when appropriate. This means you can use the same `main` branch on both personal and work machines - no branch switching needed!

## zsh

This is a git subtree of [zsh-quickstart-kit](https://github.com/unixorn/zsh-quickstart-kit). To update, follow the git subtree update strategy [outlined by Atlassian blog](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-subtree):

Adding the subtree as a remote allows us to refer to it in shorter form:

```bash
git remote add -f zsh-quickstart-kit git@github.com:unixorn/zsh-quickstart-kit.git
```

(This is only done initially) Now we can add the subtree (as before), but now we can refer to the remote in short form:

```bash
git subtree add --prefix zsh zsh-quickstart-kit main --squash
```

The command to update the sub-project at a later date becomes:

```bash
git fetch zsh-quickstart-kit main
git subtree pull --prefix zsh zsh-quickstart-kit main --squash
```

### Adding zsh completions

Here is how you can add new zsh completions, like adding Google Cloud SDK completions as indicated in `brew` caveats

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.zsh-completions
ln -s /usr/local/Caskroom/google-cloud-sdk/latest/google-cloud-sdk/path.zsh.inc ~/.zsh-completions/path.zsh.inc
ln -s /usr/local/Caskroom/google-cloud-sdk/latest/google-cloud-sdk/completion.zsh.inc ~/.zsh-completions/completion.zsh.inc
```
